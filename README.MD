# wrong way Racer

## Stack:
- React, Vite, MUI, PIXI.js, Nodejs, and Socket.io

### Due to limited time, I did not ship all features, here are my notes:
- solve the PIXI issue [browser hanging due to usage of Pixi ticker and stage] (so I stop moving the car)
- solve parallax issues for mountains and side roads
- Refactoring
- Use the react-redux toolkit, for the player's list because it is used in three components
- Complete implementation of ```handleChange``` and ```handleSubmit``` in the Chat component
- apply a nice scroll bar for [leaderboard, chat, and players list] and remove the ```overflow: hidden```
- complete the setting button to enable the user to update the name and set the difficulty level
- complete board tabs [ leaderboard, chat, and players ] for mobile
- apply testing

### Commands:
- Install dependencies : ```npm i```
- Development: ``` npm run dev ```
- Build: ``` npm run build ```
